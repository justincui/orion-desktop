# Orion Desktop

Desktop code editor for web developers based on [Eclipse Orion](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion) and [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/), similar to Atom, Brackets, LightTable or Visual Studio Code. This is still a beta version.

## Usage

Go to the `orion-desktop` directory, run `npm install` to get the latest Orion code, download [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) and run `nw orion-desktop`.

Or better download the [prebuilt package](https://github.com/niutech/orion-desktop/releases) for Windows.
